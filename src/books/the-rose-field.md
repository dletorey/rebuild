Today I finished listening to {{ title }} by {{ book.author}} read by {{ book.narrator }}. This was the third book in {{ book.series }} series.

I absolutely loved this is was so emotional and the narration was so moving at times I cried and other times I laughed out loud.

At the end of the audio book there was an interview with Philip Pullman and Michael Sheen, in that interview they discussed the ideas and themes of the book and commented upon how the current global politics were reflected in the story.

Towards the end Philip Pullman said:

> Those who don’t understand or enjoy stories and art are the ones we have to look out for.

I truly recommend The Book of Dust trilogy and I really didn't want it to end.
