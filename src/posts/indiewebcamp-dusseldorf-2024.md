At the beginning of the day, my blog only had posts there was literally no way of finding those posts other than knowing the URL and this is what I wanted to fix.

## What I did

- Created a list of post on the [Home page](/)
- Made the list of posts into Cards, these cards contain:
  - `<header>` with the title
  - `<main>` with a description and date (the date is currently static)
  - `<footer>` with a list of tags of the post
- Added link to home in the site footer

## What I didn't get done

- Sort the posts by date
- Add missing dates
- Make the tags into links to it shows a list of other post with the same tag
