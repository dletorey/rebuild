<p>Well, when I say built, what I actually meaning is building.</p>
<p>By no means is this blog finished and I don't expect it to be finished anytime soon, if ever.</p>
<p>So why have I built (building) this:</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>So I can write about what I'm <a href="https://letorey.co.uk/about">passionate</a>
 about, you know:</p>
<ul><li>Music</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Travel</li>
<li>Lego</li>
<li>The Web</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>The industry I work in changes daily, every morning I read about a new practice or JavaScript Library or whatever. So this will allow me to write about what I've learnt in the building of this humble site.</p>
<p>The development of this blog can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dletorey/letorey.co.uk" title="letorey.co.uk Github Repository">github</a>
.</p>
<p>This blog is built on <a href="https://matrix.squiz.net">Squiz Matrix CMS</a>
, it's what I do during the week and probably way overkill for a simple blog, but will allow me to talk about development and new features in Squiz Matrix.</p>
<h2>What's happening</h2>
<p>I've started a <a href="https://letorey.co.uk/style-guide">Style Guide</a>
, which will continue to grow overtime.</p>
<p>There a <a href="https://letorey.co.uk/new-features">new features</a>
 that need adding to this blog.</p>
<p>I already have a <a href="https://letorey.co.uk/things-to-write-about">backlog of posts</a>
 to write to, these will also drive what features are added first.</p>
