Today was our last day in Oaxaca and so after breakfast at [Muss Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hYJDwXjgXdKPQ19G9) we went to buyer some souvenirs and presents. 

After this we went back to Sabina Sabe for more cocktails again the cocktails were fabulous.

In the evening we went to [La Azotea](https://azotea360.com.mx/) a roof top restaurant, the views were amazing but the food fell well short, style over substance. After food we tried to get into the Sevla cocktail bar but for some reason I didn't understand so instead we went to Muss Cafe where they have a roof top bar. We sat outside on the roof drank cocktails and watch a lightning storm in the clouds.
