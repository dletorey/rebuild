This week has not been the best. For example I updated my phone to the latest software and now every time I make a call it shows me a picture of my [mum](/leets/mum/). I could make it stop doing this but I don’t want to make my mum not be one of my favourites. I’ll get over this but that time is not yet. 

## Underworld

So tonight I went to see Underworld, again, with a load of mates (and I’m doing it again tomorrow).

I’m not going to spoil it for anyone other than to say it was joyous! Absolutely fucking joyous! If there was a heaven and my mum was there she’d have been looking down at me smiling at just happy I was.

They didn’t play my favourite track [Mmm…Skyscraper I love you](https://song.link/gb/i/1443922014). But they did play my second favourite [Moaner](https://song.link/gb/i/1445884314).

As I am going again tomorrow, and boy am I delighted that I am, I left just before they played Born Slippy. I just want to make sure that tomorrow I get it full in my face. Plus I wanted to get out before the masses tomorrow I am going to the after party so escape is not needed.

Tonight’s show as if someone had asked Rick if he could weaponise the music. He certainly did he changed his synths into a joy canon and assaulted 5000 ravers with pure joy. My cheeks are still hurting from grinning like a loon.
