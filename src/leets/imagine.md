Imagine being in jail for destroying a drone that was going to be used to kill possibly 100s of innocent people.

Imagine being in jail for 421 days without being charged for anything.

Imagine being in jail for 421 days and still having to wait at least 138 days until your trial.

Imagine being denied your fundamental human rights.

Imagine being denied the right to privacy.

Imagine being denied a clean bed.

Imagine access to books restricted.

Imagine access to visits restricted.

Imagine being transferred hundreds of miles away from your family and support system.

Imagine your only form of protest is your body.

Imagine using your body to protest by starving yourself.

Imagine not eating for 73 days.

Imagine having to tell your friends that your are probably going to die in the next few days.

Imagine being a Prime Minister, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and letting this happen.

Imagine funding from foreign powers being more important that this.

> “Physically, I am deteriorating as the days go by. I no longer feel hunger, I feel pain,” Muraisi said. “I don’t think about my life, I think about how or when I could die, but despite this, mentally I’ve never been stronger, more determined and sure, and most importantly, I feel calm and a great sense of ease.”

## Not the only Hunger Striker

Heba is not the only [hunger striker](https://prisonersforpalestine.org/) she is just the one that has not eaten the longest.
