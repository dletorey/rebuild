Woke up feeling much better, still not 100% but way better. Today we went for a walk down to the beach and into Centro Historico in Mazatlán so we could see it in day light.

The seafront was so much quieter that eclipse day only like 10% of the people on the previous day.

The previous day I saw loads of birds, today I found out what they were, they were [Magnificent Frigatebirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificent_frigatebird) and also [pelicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican). Seeing the pelicans waddle across the beach made me think of Princess (love you mate).

The Centro Historico in daylight was completely difficult the colours of the building absolutely stunning.

On the way back to the apartment we walked along the beach and Susan had a paddle.

When we got back to the apartment I noticed that through a gap there was a coffee shop/bar called [Coffee Break Mazatlán](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zPijFSv4srHbDo8cA). So I went to investigate. The staff were wearing t-shirts that read “So Fucking Delicious” and they were right the coffee was awesome.

When I returned to the apartment Susan and I had a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/game/daily/644193005) and she thrashed me.

Later in the afternoon I went for a walk this time the opposite direction to the beach. This is where the people of Mazatlán actually live and work. There were plenty of food places, barbers and car repair places. As I was getting back to our apartment [I could hear a mariachi band, this time a good one](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53648140181/in/album-72177720316124504/). As I got closer I could see that they had taken over and pretty much closed the road. On investigation there was someone’s birthday party happening. It was so close that for the next few hours we could hear the party going on from our apartment.

The rest of the day we just chilled and had an early night.
