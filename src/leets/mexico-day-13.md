Today was our third Tour and final tour in Mexico [El Tule, Mitla, and Hierve el Agua Tour with Mezcal](https://www.getyourguide.co.uk/oaxaca-de-juarez-l681/oaxaca-el-tule-mitla-and-hierve-el-agua-tour-w-transfer-t428000/). This time we were picked up from our hotel. Although they turned up 30 minutes before they said they would and we were just about to go get coffee and breakfast. Susan's power of persuasion (her inner-jaguar) meant that I could run round the corner to [Muss coffee shop](https://www.casaantonieta.com/muss-cafe-english). When  got there they were just unlocking but they were kind enough to make me two coffees and sell me some chocolate brownies.

We then set off to pick up the other participants from their hotels, there were 8 of in all 4 from Mexico (2 from Tijuana and 2 from Chihuahua) 2 from Delaware and Susan and I.

Our first stop of the day was to see [√Årbol del Tule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81rbol_del_Tule) the tree with the largest girth in the world at 58 metres. [This tree is a Montezuma cypress](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53662533228/in/album-72177720316315614/lightbox/) and super impressive. Just outside the gates to the tree there was [an aerobics class going on](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53662779285/in/album-72177720316315614/lightbox/) playing rock n roll and 80s power ballads. Our guide, Ede, pointed out to use with a laser pointer all the parts of the tree that were supposed to look like animals. [Perched in the tree there was a green parrot](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53662534398/in/album-72177720316315614/lightbox/), I also saw a flock of green parrots flying around.

Our second stop of the day was [Mitla an archeological site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitla).
