Today was our third Tour and final tour in Mexico [El Tule, Mitla, and Hierve el Agua Tour with Mezcal](https://www.getyourguide.co.uk/oaxaca-de-juarez-l681/oaxaca-el-tule-mitla-and-hierve-el-agua-tour-w-transfer-t428000/). This time we were picked up from our hotel. Although they turned up 30 minutes before they said they would and we were just about to go get coffee and breakfast. Susan's power of persuasion (her inner-jaguar) meant that I could run round the corner to [Muss coffee shop](https://www.casaantonieta.com/muss-cafe-english). When  got there they were just unlocking but they were kind enough to make me two coffees and sell me some chocolate brownies.

We then set off to pick up the other participants from their hotels, there were 8 of in all 4 from Mexico (2 from Tijuana and 2 from Chihuahua) 2 from Delaware and Susan and I.

Our first stop of the day was to see [√Årbol del Tule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81rbol_del_Tule) the tree with the largest girth in the world at 58 metres. [This tree is a Montezuma cypress](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53662533228/in/album-72177720316315614/lightbox/) and super impressive. Just outside the gates to the tree there was [an aerobics class going on](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53662779285/in/album-72177720316315614/lightbox/) playing rock n roll and 80s power ballads. Our guide, Ede, pointed out to use with a laser pointer all the parts of the tree that were supposed to look like animals. [Perched in the tree there was a green parrot](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53662534398/in/album-72177720316315614/lightbox/), I also saw a flock of green parrots flying around.

Our second stop of the day was [Mitla an archeological site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitla). Mitla is known as the _place of the dead_ in the [Zapotec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_peoples) culture. When the Spanish arrived they were told that if the touched the main building that the dead would come back and haunt them, this meant that the part stayed intact unlike many other sites which were demolished for the stones to build churches. Inside there are many intricate friezes decorating the tops of the walls and still some of the original paintings.

Our third stop of the day was [Hierve el Agua]() some limestone waterfalls with natural pools. Ede gave us 3 options to go see and explore the waterfalls and pools of varying difficulty, we chose the easiest route so we could maximise our time in the pools. Initially getting into the pool was cold but as soon as you were in it was absolutely delightful and lovely to be a bit cooler. We stayed there about an hour and half. While walking back up to the bus we met the girl from Glasgow and the girls from West Sussex we met [the previous day](/leets/mexico-day-12) on the cookery course.

Next we stopped off for a Mexican buffet and like all these lunch stops on the tours, it was mediocre at best. While there the locals were watching the Manchester City versus Real Madrid Champions league quarter final. The game finished in a draw and went to extra-time, we later found out that Manchester City lost 4-5 on penalties. Arsenal were also knocked out oof the Champions league too.
