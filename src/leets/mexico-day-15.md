Today was our last day in Mexico again we had breakfast at [Muss Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hYJDwXjgXdKPQ19G9) and then got our taxi to Oaxaca Airport for our last night before we flew home.

Our last hotel was [Fiesta Americana Viaducto Aeropuerto](https://www.fiestamericana.com/hoteles-y-resorts/fiesta-americana-viaducto-aeropuerto), which as the name suggests was pretty close to the airport to make our next day easier. The hotel was pretty nice and we were on the 7th floor the shower had a view out over the city. The hotel was also pretty close to the Sports area of the city and in our hotel room there was a picture of [Lewis Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) driving his Mercedes F1 car.

I took the opportunity to [go for a walk](https://www.strava.com/activities/11219792846) and see [Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aut%C3%B3dromo_Hermanos_Rodr%C3%ADguez) the circuit where the Mexican Grand Prix is held. I couldn't get in to the circuit, but I was able to see [the main grandstand and part of the circuit](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53668685846/in/album-72177720316366276/lightbox/). I was also able to see [Palacio de los Deportes (Palace of Sports)](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53669141885/in/album-72177720316366276/lightbox/) which was like [The Millenium Dome (O2 Arena)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Dome).

Later on we had a meal at the hotel, which was pretty mediocre, before retiring to bed.
