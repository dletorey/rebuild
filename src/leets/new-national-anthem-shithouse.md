A week ago I said to Susan:

> If I took you away next Saturday would that be okay?

It turns out it was.

## No tickets

Only thing was I didn’t have tickets and when I looked it was all sold out! I thought that Big Special were playing [Rock City]() but oh no they were playing next door at [Rescue Rooms]() a much smaller venue. So I had to rely on [Twickets](https://twickets.live).

Thursday had come round and not a thing at all had been posted on Twickets. Friday was busy. I started by heading to Mackbear (my local coffee shop) for coffee and spinach borek. While there I did some more prep work for [State of the Browser](https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com), do this at 8am I got a notification from Twickets because it was so early I was able to bag one ticket for Big Special.

After breakfast I headed to meet Rog at [Only with love brewery](https://www.onlywithlove.co/), while there I got another Twickets notification this time it was gone before I got in.

I then went to Lewes for some lunch before heading to Muddles Green to hangout with my friends Barrie & Christina. Eventually I received another notification from Twickets and again I was too slowly. I kept refreshing and then I was blocked by Twickets. Finally another ticket and I was able to get a second needed ticket.

## Gig day

Susan still had idea what we were doing and where we going.

When we got to Nottingham and park the car we walked past Rock City on the way to the hotel. Susan asked “are we going to see a band at Rock City?” I could confidently say no.

### Wonder Pho

On Ian’s recommendation we went to [Wonder Pho Lounge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7qiR8y4mVRAC8bFZ8?g_st=ic). When we entered I asked for a table for 4 people, yet another surprise for Susan. A few minutes later we were joined by, birthday boy, Simon & Allanah.

The food and drinks were excellent although the service was a bit slow and they confused some of the orders.

We went to get drinks at [The horn in hand](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rCUueMge15rAPybG8?g_st=ic), they literally had no drinks and suggested that we go to the [Rescue Rooms](https://www.rescuerooms.com/) which was next door.

In the bar we had some drinks, they even sold [Mash Gang Chug](https://mashgang.com/products/chug-alcohol-free-hazy-ipa/) on tap. Susan went to the merch stand and got a Big Special tour shirt and some raffle tickets as they were fund raising for a friend’s family as he had recently died of cancer.

After a drink Simon and Allanah had to leave to get the train home. We got another drink and headed into the venue.

### Gans

We had missed the first support act [Good health good wealth](https://www.goodhealthgoodwealth.com/). The second support were [Gans](https://gansnet.os.fan/) another West Midlands based band. The consisted of a Drummer/Lead singer, a guitarist/bassist/keyboard player/singer and a flautist/saxaphonist/303 player. Their energy and performance was amazing I’m delighted that we get to see them again at [Bearded Theory](https://beardedtheory.co.uk/) on the Wednesday.

### Big Special

The headliner was [Big Special](https://bigspecial.co.uk/) also from the West Midlands. I’d only seen them once before when they supported [John Grant](https://www.johngrantmusic.com/) at Hackney Church in October 2024. 

The set was amazing and humble they pointed out that they were liberals and said:

> Anyone voting reform go fuck yourselves!

Towards the end of the set they played what they referred to as _The New National Anthem_ - [Shithouse](https://song.link/i/1793598416). And finished with [Trees](https://song.link/i/1793599022).
