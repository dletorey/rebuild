Our one day in Kamala beach Phuket was a day of relaxation and chilling. We go up late and then went for breakfast at [Kamala Coffee House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/crEcx51oMrX1epz59). After breakfast Susan went back to the hotel to use the gym and have a massage.

## Kamala beach

Sarah and I went for a walk along to the end of the beach. As we walked a long the path behind we saw a walled off area with some small round pillars, [I suspected that this was a cemetery and on checking Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f5HRvq42zoxbrW2a7) my suspicion was confirm. Looking more closely I saw that a complete gammon had left this review:

> It's wrong to have a cemetery in a beautiful tourist spot. It's supposed to be a place of entertainment or hotels because of its proximity to the beach. - [Mango](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y29y9e5fatXyEPe89)

When we got to the end of the beach we noticed that there were patterns in the sand, we discovered that these were made by [Sand bubbler crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_bubbler_crab), they feed by filtering sand through their mouthparts, leaving behind balls of sand that are broken up by the incoming high tide.

On the way back to the hotel we witnessed Giant black squirrels leaping from one tree to another it was amazing to see but impossible to capture on camera. Back at the hotel I relaxed by the pool and updated my blog.

## Duck spicy

Before we traveled to Thailand we discovered a review of a restaurant in the next bay over from Kamala. That restaurant was called Duck Spicy. So I opened up Bolt and entered Duck Spicy, the price was very cheap and I was delighted. The driver messaged me to say that they'd be there very soon and would I wait, I reply of course I would. The driver arrived and drove us 300m round the corner from out hotel and stopped, he looked at us and was confused that we were not getting out, he then said [this is where we wanted to go](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ggSSYbFp9ZSSBDSg7). It turns out that there was more than 1 Duck Spicy, it's not a chain it's just a popular name. So out we got and summoned a new car to take us to [the correct Duck Spicy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sHEPmC2mLmoheFuMA).

When we got there the restaurant raised above the road, looking out over the sea and along the bay. The food was amazing and there was a Thai singer serenading us while we ate. For desert we both had Deep fried ice cream which was amazing. We then headed back to Kamala for our last night out with our friends.
