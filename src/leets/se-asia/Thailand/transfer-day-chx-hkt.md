Today we left Chiang Mai and flew to Phuket. At Chiang Mai (CHX) Airport it was a bit chaotic and we were in a queue, a long queue, for a while and then we realised that we could use the self check-in machines. This was all good until Mike's bag was overweight. This meant that he had to join the original queue. Fortunately, after paying extra, he managed to make it through security in time to catch the flight but it was tight. The best thing about the flight was the in flight magazine called Redcap (I may have stolen this).

Once at Phuket (HKT) Airport, we split into 2 groups as Susan, Sarah and I were staying in a different hotel to the others. We managed to hail a Bolt taxi, but when we looked the taxi was the opposite side of the airport car park, we crossed the road lifted the trolley over a small fence and proceeded to walk to the other side of the car park. Once we got there the driver cancelled and we had to hail a new one. The new one turned up and had a red leather interior. The journey to the hotel took about 45 minutes. The welcome in our room was a towel bunny surrounded by the word _welcome_ cut out of green leaves.

That night we spent in a local bar eating, drinking and chatting.
