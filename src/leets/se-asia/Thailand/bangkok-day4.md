Today was a transfer day from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, although our flight was not until 17:45 so we had the morning to explore.

## Lumphini park

We choose our hotel partly because of its closeness to a park that I'd seen on a travel show about Thailand that I really wanted to see. The park was 15 minute walk from our hotel and on the way we stopped off for coffee.

The park was quite big and had a number of lakes within it. We walked around the big lake and onto an island. On the way round we witnesses all sorts of people exercising, runners, Thai Chi, Yoga and old people exercising with what looked like samurai swords.

There were loads of different animals there were fish, loads of pigeons and ravens. But of course there were also Water Monitors (alternatively known as _Bangkok Dragons_), these were up to 2 metres long. At one point we came across a group of lizards all piled up on top of each other.

## To Chiang Mai

After the park we headed back to the hotel, checked out and the hotel took us in a minibus back to Bangkok airport. At the airport we met up with Audrey & Tracey, they were waiting just by our check-in desk. The rest of the journey to Chiang Mai was easy and uneventful.

At Chiang Mai, we had planned on getting some large Bolt cars to take us to the hotel alas all the large cars were unavailable. Where we were meeting after collecting our bags there was a stall offering Minibus Transfers, we go a deal for ฿300 (about £8) to take all 9 of us to our hotel. Chiang Mai airport (CNX) is very close to the city centre and the transfer took about 15 minutes.

We all checked in and after a short while we met at a bar Zoe in Yellow close to our hotel. After a few drinks, Nick found a restaurant that was still open, we walked through the night market to the restaurant to get some food before heading off to bed.
