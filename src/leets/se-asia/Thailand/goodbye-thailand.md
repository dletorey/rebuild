Today the majority of our friends got up early to go on a boat trip to the local islands and do some snorkeling, so it was a good job that we said our goodbyes last night. We went back to Kamala coffee house for breakfast and Sarah joined us. After breakfast we checked out of our hotel and called a bolt to the airport, Sarah waved us off in our minibus. The journey, check-in and immigration were all smooth. We boarded our flight and waved goodbye to Thailand, we had had such a lovely time there.

## Siem Reap (SAI) airport

Compared to all the airports in Thailand, Siem Reap (SAI) airport was very quiet, it was very easy getting through immigration we'd already applied for our eVisas and entry cards. The immigration did not stamp our passports but instead printed a sticker with a QR code with our visa and entry details. Once we'd picked up our bags there was a driver, from our hotel, was waiting for us.

The drive to the hotel was about 50 minutes and at first there was no buildings at all just thousands of cashew nut trees. The driver told us that Cambodia was the place of Sunsets. As we got closer to Siem Reap we started to see stalls along the side of the road but still quite quiet. While were driving the sun was starting to fade and it was starting to get dark. 

Then we arrived in Siem Reap and everything was illuminated, even the lamp posts had lights the full length of them. I looked like a cross between Blackpool & Las Vegas. Then as we got closer to our hotel we passed _Pub Street_!

Once we had checked in to our hotel, [The Urban](https://www.staynature.net/property/the-urban/), we headed out to Pub Street and found a restaurant called [Mesa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WvMQ2yXFDrDAc9G88). The restaurant was excellent and all the staff had football shirts with the restaurant name and their names, our waiter was called Leo. As we were tired, we went back to the hotel for an early night and watched the Formula 1 Qatar sprint race.
