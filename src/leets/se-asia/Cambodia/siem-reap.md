## Exploring Siem Reap

After a lie in this morning we found a coffee shop, [Asagohan Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o5aFGC684T15m2yr8) to have a leisurely brunch this place was great. We then went for a walk to explore the city.

Firstly we walked through Pub Street, which was much less brash and noisy during the day time and headed to the canal. The walk along the canal was shady which was good because the temperature was already 33ºc. It was not long before we encountered our first temple of Cambodia, [Wat Preah Prom Rath](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kdekHJ63Po9YxbpR8), it was lovely and we came across a sculpture of a man having his insides eaten by vultures.
