We have been planning this trip since January, when we all met up in York to discuss when and where we were going to holiday together this time.

## Travel

We all started off in different airports around the UK:

- Susan and I Stansted (STN)
- Liz & Nick Birmingham (BHX)
- Sarah Manchester (MAN)
- Debbie and Mike Newcastle (NCL)
- Eleanor and Tony Glasgow (GLA)

It turns out that Emirates flies from many different locations now in the UK. All of our flights departed within an hour of each other.

Approximately 7 hours later we all met up in O'Regans Irish Bar at Dubai airport (DBX), there wasn't much Irish-ness about this place but after a few drinks we finally boarded our flight to Bangkok (BKK).
