This is my kind of cat!!

[Kittens by Underworld](https://song.link/i/1442297194) absolutely banging. So far it’s better than [last night](/leets/you-let-light-in/) and we’re only half way through. So let’s see.

## Second set

Boom! Just as epic as the first set. Absolutely savage. 

They also played [_and the colour red_](https://song.link/i/1678431352) and the whole room was filled with red lights, red lasers and glowing grinning faces.

## Born Slippy

Controversial I know but this definitely not their best track it’s just their most famous. 

This blatantly obvious, because as soon as it started 90% of the audience, well certainly the younger members of the audience, all got their phones out. 

They did a superb job of this and everyone was very excited. At the end there were huge confetti canons quite a sight. 

I even managed to get the set list of the second set and then we headed to the Underworld Drift Afterparty put on by my friend Paul.

Great night again¡
