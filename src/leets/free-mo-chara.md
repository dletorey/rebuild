The outcome of the case was that the judge has yet again decided to postpone the decision, to 26 September, on whether or not he will face terror charges.

I arrived at the court about 11:00 and there had been people there since before 09:00. There were already a couple of thousand people there, almost 100 police and about 40 news teams.

There was a small stage, on which there were a number of performances, I have no idea the names of the performers. When I arrived there was a palestinian rapper wear a camouflage jacket that on the back read: _More Blacks More Dogs More Irish_. 

There was presentation from [Gaza Sunbirds](https://gazasunbirds.org/) Palestine's Para-Cycling Team, from this I learnt:

- From March 2018 - December 2019 there was protests every Friday on the border of Gaza called [Great March of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932019_Gaza_border_protests), during which 223 Palestinians were killed.
- During one of the protests Palestine's top cyclist was shot in the leg with an exploding bullet and this is why **Gaza Sunbirds** were formed.

At the end of the presentation the presenter said:

> You can steal land and you can steal money<br>
> But you can’t steal freedom and you can’t steal power<br>
> Power to the people

There were a poems read and then a Gazan lady told a tale of what is going on over there and the thing that I took away from this was about the games Gazan children are now playing:

> They run in zig zags to avoid the bullets.<br>
> And while running they chant:<br>
> _If you die you lose, if you die you lose_

The whole point of these trumped up terrorist charges are to draw peoples attention from what is happening in Gaza, if the news is full of Kneecap stories (and they have done nothing wrong) then there is less time to see what is happening in Gaza.
