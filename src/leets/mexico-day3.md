Luckily last night I found the Japanese Grand Prix on Mexican TV. The race started at 11pm local time, although it did not help that on the first lap there was a crash and the barriers needing repairing. The commentary on BBC radio just said "I bet all those who got up at 5am are now a bit pissed off" or words to those effect. Unfortunately the race was pretty dull and I finally got to go to sleep and almost 2am. Surprisingly enough the Mexican commentary was very swayed to one driver, but quite funny trying to work out exactly what they were saying.

This morning I got up and went exploring to find some pastries for our breakfast. Again it would appear that Mexicans do not do mornings and the streets were deserted yet again. I walked again in the direction of the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral hoping to find the square with very few people. On the way I came across a [super-bakery](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53638574895/in/album-72177720316067013/) here there was every baked good you can imagine. It took me a while but I notice, eventually, that all the customers were carrying trays and piling them high with cakes, croissants, cookies and danishes. So I [grabbed myself a tray and started piling](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53638456394/in/album-72177720316067013/), I just could not choose.

It also turns out that every Sunday in Mexico City there is an unofficial marathon in the Centro Historico and there were runners everywhere when I got there. The other thing I noticed when I got to the square was [the Policia were being inspected](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53638575660/in/album-72177720316067013/) before they started there work day.

When I got back to the hotel, Susan was not feeling great (not my story to tell), so we decided to go to the airport early. Upon arriving I used my pigeon-spanish to communicate with the airline staff to find out if we could check in our bags early and get through security. Once through I went into discovery mode to find an airport lounge that we could hide in until our flight was ready.

The lounge ([Grand Lounge Elite](https://thegrandloungeelite.com.mx/)), situated at gate 19, was brilliant, brilliant WiFi, [food](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53638398713/in/album-72177720316067013/), [drinks](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53637297652/in/album-72177720316067013/) and reclining chairs. They also offered us manicures and pedicures. But best of all they provided us with a golf buggy to take us to our gate when we are ready.

To be continued as it's only 13:30â€¦
