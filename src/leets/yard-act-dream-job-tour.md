Last night I went to see Yard Act at Hammersmith Apollo. This was the second time this year seeing them, the first was at [Pryzm Kington](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/yard-act/2024/pryzm-kingston-upon-thames-england-2bad0066.html) for their Album launch of [Where's my Utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_My_Utopia%3F).

Last nights gig was brilliant and I'd rate it 5/5. The band were on top form and the crowd were lapping up everything thrown at them.

During the tour each night one track in the set list was decided by a member of the audience spinning a wheel, last night it was the turn of Tara who's birthday it was and here friends were on stage with her and presented her a [colin the caterpillar cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_the_Caterpillar). After a rousing rendition of Happy birthday Tarra span the wheel and [Peanuts](https://song.link/i/1545738650) was chosen.

If you get a chance to [see them this year](https://www.yardactors.com/live/) then just at it, the put on a great show.
