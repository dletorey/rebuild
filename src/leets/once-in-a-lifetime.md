Susan & I travelled to Belgium to see [David Byrne's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne) [**Who is the Sky?**](https://album.link/i/1816027264) tour. The venue was new to us it was the [Forest National](https://www.forest-national.be/en) in Brussels. It was similar to Wembley Arena, in London, but about a third of the size. We had great seats central and near the sound desk.

The staging was superb and the set was fantastic, I'm not going to say more than this because I know people who are going to see this tour at a later date and don't want to spoil anything.

If you like David Byrne or [Talking Heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads) then I recommend that you do everything to go see this tour, it was truly _Once in a Lifetime_.
