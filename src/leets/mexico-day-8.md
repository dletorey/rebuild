Today we had a relaxed day to try and regain some of our strength, I started off finding a coffee at [Ukiyo café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ukgznWKJfcgEtiYh9) which was wonderful. Then Susan and I went to [Saks](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W47pL8QLdgY4CKvq6) which just so happens to be the closest restaurant to our accommodation. There was a huge queue and we were told maximum of 20 minutes wait. We only had to wait about 5 minutes. The [room was stunning](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53648780612/in/album-72177720316186853/lightbox/), I had a smoked salmon omelette and Susan had an appley-thing (Apple Special, grated apple with yoghurt honey nuts and raisins), both excellent.

In the afternoon Susan relaxed and read her 100th book of the holiday while I went for [a walk around Chapultepec Forest](https://www.strava.com/activities/11166961638) the largest park in Mexico City. The park also contains the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo, Zoológico de Chapultepec to name a few things.

Towards the end of my walk I came upon some men at the top of a 20m pole who were winding ropes around the top and once all the rope had been wound [they jumped off and span down to the ground](https://flickr.com/photos/dletorey/53650019711/in/album-72177720316186853/lightbox/), one of the maddest things things I've ever witnessed.
