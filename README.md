# letorey.co.uk Rebuild

This is the repo for the rebuild of my personal site. I have chosen to use 11ty canary for this.

## Eleventy

- [Get started](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/get-started/)

### Run eleventy

```sh
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

This should respond with the number of files and version of 11ty

### serve 11ty files locally

Use --serve to start up a hot-reloading local web server.

```sh
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

This should respond with what host the files are served from, the default is `http://localhost:8080/` but this can be changed.
